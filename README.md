# Block Ciphers
In the qualification work, an online service was developed and implemented to demonstrate message 
encryption to users who are studying this topic. The online service was developed as a mobile application for Android in the Kotlin programming language. 
A simple interface with a navigation menu was developed. On the main screen, the user can choose a block cipher. After selecting the cipher, a new window opens where you can enter the message 
to be encrypted or decrypted and the key and see the result.
